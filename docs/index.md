# MkDocs Guide

## Introduction

MkDocs is a fast, simple and downright gorgeous static site generator that's geared towards building project documentation. Documentation source files are written in Markdown, and configured with a single YAML configuration file.

## Installation

To install MkDocs, you'll need Python installed on your system, as well as the Python package manager, pip. You can check if you have these already installed by running:

```
python --version
pip --version
```

If you have Python and pip installed, you can install MkDocs by running:

```
pip install mkdocs
```

You can verify that everything installed correctly by running:

```
mkdocs --version
```

## Getting Started

To create a new project, run:

```
mkdocs new my-project
cd my-project
```

This will create a new MkDocs project with the default theme. You can preview your site by running:

```
mkdocs serve
```

This will start a server at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.

## Customizing Your Site

You can customize your site by editing the `mkdocs.yml` configuration file. This file is used to configure your site's title, theme, plugins, and other settings.

## Building Your Site

When you're ready to build your site, run:

```
mkdocs build
```

This will create a new directory, named `site`, containing your built site.

## Deploying Your Site

To deploy your site, you can use the `gh-deploy` command:

```
mkdocs gh-deploy
```

This will build your docs and use the `ghp-import` tool to commit them to the `gh-pages` branch and push the `gh-pages` branch to GitHub.

## Conclusion

MkDocs is a powerful tool for building project documentation. It's easy to install, easy to use, and highly customizable. Happy documenting!
