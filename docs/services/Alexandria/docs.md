## Introduction

Alexandria is a powerful service designed to help you manage your data effectively and efficiently. With Alexandria, you can store, retrieve, and manipulate your data with ease.

## Getting Started

Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- An Alexandria account
- API key

You can obtain your API key from the Alexandria dashboard.

```
# To use the Alexandria service, you can make a request like this:

curl -X POST https://api.alexandria.com/data \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY' \
  -d '{
    "data": "YOUR_DATA_HERE"

Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual API key, and `YOUR_DATA_HERE` with the data you want to store.
