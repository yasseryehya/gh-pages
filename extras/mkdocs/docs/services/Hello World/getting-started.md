## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

## Step 1: Sign Up

To use the Hello World service, you first need to sign up. Visit our Sign Up page and fill out the registration form.

## Step 3: Hello, World!

Now you're ready to use the Hello World service! Open your text editor and create a new file. Type `Hello, World!` and save the file.

```
# For example, if you're using a Unix-based system and the nano text editor, you can do this:

nano hello.txt
# Type "Hello, World!" and then press Ctrl+X to save and exit.
```

Congratulations! You've just created your first Hello World file.
